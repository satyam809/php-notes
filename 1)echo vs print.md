In PHP, both `echo` and `print` are used to output data to the screen, but they have some differences:

1. **`echo`**:
   - `echo` is a language construct (not a function) and is more efficient than `print`.
   - It can take multiple arguments separated by commas.
   - It does not return a value, so it cannot be used within expressions.

   Example:
   ```php
   echo 'Hello, ', 'World!';
   ```

2. **`print`**:
   - `print` is a function and returns a value (1 for success, always).
   - It can only take a single argument, which should be enclosed in parentheses.
   - It can be used within expressions, but it is less efficient compared to `echo`.

   Example:
   ```php
   print('Hello, World!');
   ```

Here's a direct comparison:

```php
// Using echo
echo 'Hello, ', 'World!'; // Output: Hello, World!

// Using print
print('Hello, World!'); // Output: Hello, World!
```

In most cases, developers prefer using `echo` because it is more efficient and versatile for outputting data. `print` is used less frequently, primarily when you need its return value, but it can be used for simple output as well.
